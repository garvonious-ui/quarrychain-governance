/**
 * Validator avatar with a graceful fallback.
 *
 * The initials are ALWAYS rendered, and the logo is layered on top of them
 * rather than swapped in for them. This matters: an earlier version rendered
 * the <img> instead of the initials and only fell back once onError fired,
 * which flashed an empty square on every page load for any validator whose
 * asset was missing. Layering means the worst case is "initials stay visible"
 * instead of "empty box until the 404 resolves".
 *
 * The image carries its own background so a logo with transparency doesn't
 * let the initials show through behind it — which means it would also mask the
 * initials while still loading. So it stays at opacity-0 until onLoad fires.
 * That is deliberately fail-closed: if a logo never loads we show initials
 * forever, which is the right outcome given assets are currently missing.
 * Verified against the dev server: present assets return 200 through the image
 * optimizer, missing ones return 400 and trip onError.
 *
 * Brand assets have not been delivered yet — drop files into public/assets
 * (see the README there) and they light up with no code change.
