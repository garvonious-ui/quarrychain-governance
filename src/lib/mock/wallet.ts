 * Demo wallet summary for the Quarry Wallet Dashboard.

 * Simulated — there is no connected wallet until Phase 6. The layout mirrors
 * the RWA Marketplace demo, with the holdings section replaced by active
 * delegations. A few representative delegations are seeded so the Manage Pool
 * section is populated, exactly as the reference demo's holdings table is.
